ImageCapture.rb

# JUST A ROUGH DRAFT. WILL FIX UP... EVENTUALLY!

A program to capture webcam images "DURING" login failures.

You need to edit your login daemons pam file. I use Linux Mint over Gnome3(not mate). So I modified the gdm-password file in the /etc/pam.d/ directory.

I prepended this line 
auth sufficient pam_listfile.so item=user file=/path/to/userAuthFile sense=allow onerr=succeed

to my gdm-password file. Read here for a breakdown of this pam SO file http://linux.die.net/man/8/pam_listfile

What that does is it tells PAM when it authenticates against the gdm daemon to allow automatic login and access to the desktop/user if the user is in the specified auth file. Arguments can be passed to the methods of my tail class to prevent such a thing if you desire.

googles GeoLocation API for Ruby https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/ruby/start/get_started

I am renting a web space from a host and have built a page to log geolocation. It is very accurate. The page is a mix of HTML5, JavaScript and PHP. The location is grabbed with HTML and JS and the data is passed to the php file. This is the site http://trutechdesigns.com/ I have included the HTML/JS file as well as the PHP script. 

The Ruby program opens your broswer with my site and your location is emailed within seconds. The Ruby program then closes the tab. So you have no clue that this just happened.

The program is run as root and in order to run chrome from the command line as root, you need to pass it the --user-data-dir switch. You must point it to a non-root directory.(Already taken care of for you in my program) You also need the chrome webdriver binary and add it to your path. Then copy to /usr/bin or where ever you want/need to place it. 

Here is watirs site http://watirwebdriver.com/chrome/

here is the dir that the webdriver binary reside in http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html

Watir is pretty cool! It opens your browser with the supplied url, then closes if specified. It also does a lot of other cool stuff too!

as stated above then link the shared object libraries with the following command.
        sudo ln -sf /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libudev.so.1 /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libudev.so.0
